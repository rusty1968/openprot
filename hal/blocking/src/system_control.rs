//! # Design Considerations
//!
//! This module defines traits and error types for abstracting system-level
//! clock and reset control operations. The design emphasizes **flexibility**,
//! **composability**, and **extensibility** to support a wide range of hardware
//! platforms and use cases.
//!
//! ## Flexibility
//!
//! - **Platform Independence**: The traits abstract hardware-specific operations,
//!   allowing implementations to target different platforms without modifying
//!   consumer code.
//! - **Custom Identifiers and Configurations**: Associated types like `ClockId`,
//!   `ClockConfig`, and `ResetId` allow implementers to define identifiers and
//!   configurations that match their hardware model.
//! - **Error Abstraction**: The `Error` trait and `ErrorKind` enum decouple
//!   error handling from specific implementations, enabling generic code to
//!   respond to common failure modes while supporting detailed diagnostics.
//!
//! ## Composability
//!
//! - **Unified Error Handling**: The `ErrorType` supertrait provides a consistent
//!   interface for accessing error types, enabling integration with other traits
//!   and systems.
//! - **Non-Exhaustive ErrorKind**: The `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute on `ErrorKind`
//!   allows future expansion without breaking existing code, supporting long-term
//!   composability.
//!
//! ## Extensibility
//!
//! - **Custom Error Types**: Implementers can define their own error types and
//!   map them to `ErrorKind`, enabling rich, context-specific error reporting
//!   while maintaining compatibility with generic consumers.
//! - **Vendor-Specific Configuration**: The `ClockConfig` type supports complex
//!   configuration structures such as PLL settings, dividers, or source selectors.
//! - **Partial Implementations**: While all trait methods are required, implementers
//!   can provide no-op or stub implementations for unsupported features, enabling
//!   partial functionality where appropriate.
//!
//! ## Summary
//!
//! This design provides a robust foundation for building portable, maintainable,
//! and scalable hardware abstraction layers. By leveraging Rust’s trait system,
//! it enables:
//!
//! - Reuse of generic drivers across platforms.
//! - Simplified testing and mocking.
//! - Clear contracts between hardware abstraction and higher-level logic.
