//! # I2C Hardware Abstraction Traits
//!
//! This module defines composable traits for I2C hardware abstraction following
//! a clean separation of concerns. Each trait has a specific responsibility
//! and can be composed to build complete I2C functionality.
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//!
//! The traits are designed to be:
//! - **Composable**: Small, focused traits that can be combined
//! - **Flexible**: Different implementations can pick the traits they need
//! - **Extensible**: New functionality can be added without breaking existing code
//! - **Clear**: Each trait has a single, well-defined responsibility
//!
//! ## Trait Hierarchy
//!
