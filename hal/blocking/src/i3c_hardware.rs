//! I3C target-mode server facade.
//!
//! A single, narrow trait — [`I3cTarget`] — that each controller implements
//! **directly on top of its own register interface** (ast10x0, caliptra-mcu,
//! …). It is a *deep module*: the FIFO mechanics, ISR bodies, dynamic-address
//! assignment, and IBI sequencing all live inside each controller's impl; the
//! surface exposed here is only what the pigweed server-runtime needs to hook
//! interrupts and service IPC.
//!
//! This is deliberately **not** a portable capability HAL. There is one facade,
//! not a family of segregated traits, and it is shaped by the server-runtime's
//! needs rather than by an abstract notion of portability. Portability across
//! controllers is a consequence of having more than one implementor, not a goal
//! that widens the surface.
//!
//! ```text
//! MCTP transport-i3c            consumer (out of scope here)
//!        │  IPC (send / recv / dynamic_address)
//! i3c server-runtime            hooks pigweed IRQ + IPC to the facade
//!        │  I3cTarget
//! per-controller impl           deep: registers, FIFOs, ISR, DAA, IBI
//! ```
//!
//! Scope is target mode only; controller/primary-mode operations are out of
//! scope.
