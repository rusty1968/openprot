//! Pigweed server-runtime for an I3C target.
//!
//! Wraps the host-buildable [`i3c_server`] (target-owning `Server` + request
//! dispatch) in the Pigweed WaitGroup reactor. A single IPC channel carries the
//! transport protocol ([`i3c_api`]); the I3C hardware IRQ is multiplexed onto
//! the same wait, so a frame arriving on the bus and a client request are both
//! just wake-ups.
//!
//! ## Hot path
//!
//! - **IRQ** — the wait returns the I3C interrupt signal; `on_interrupt` decodes
//!   it. On `InboundReady` the runtime drains every available frame into the
//!   server's ring, `interrupt_ack`s, and raises `USER` on the client channel so
//!   a parked client wakes. On `ResponseRead` the staged transmit was consumed,
//!   so the runtime releases outbound back-pressure and answers any held `Send`.
//!
//! ## Outbound back-pressure
//!
//! A `Send` stages a response for the controller's next private read. A second
//! `Send` arriving before that read is *held* — its IPC reply is deferred and
//! the channel dropped from the wait — so fragments are never staged faster than
//! the controller drains them. The client, being synchronous, simply blocks in
//! `channel_transact` meanwhile.
//!
//! Back-pressure is released on `ResponseRead` and, as a fallback, on the next
//! `InboundReady`: the i3c target derives `ResponseRead` from the hardware
//! `IbiDone` interrupt, which is not raised reliably after a private read, and a
//! fresh inbound request proves (by request/response ordering) the prior
//! response was read. See [`release_backpressure`].
//! - **IPC** — the wait returns `READABLE`; the runtime reads one request and
//!   dispatches. A `Recv` that consumes the latch also clears `USER`; the IRQ
//!   path re-raises it when the next frame lands.
//!
//! The **only** kernel-tagged crate in the i3c server path.
