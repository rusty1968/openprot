//! The [`DeviceTrialBoot`] commit capability contract.
//!
//! This is the gate for the downstream devices, the ones the eRoT watches
//! from outside. [`BootWatch`] checks a device's checkpoints and answers with
//! a [`WalkVerdict`], read through an [`EvidenceReader`] over the board's
//! ready lines. `Complete` means confirm, `Failed` means revert, whether the
//! device reported the failure or a checkpoint's window ran out with no
//! report at all. The eRoT stays alive across the whole flow, so nothing has
//! to persist beyond the device's own slot metadata: an orchestrator that
//! rebooted mid-update re-walks the chain from the start.
//!
//! The eRoT's own image is the same gate under a different lifetime, and it
//! is [`SelfUpdate`] instead. There the judging outlives the judge: the eRoT
//! resets into the candidate, so the verdict is reached by a later boot that
//! has to read what the previous one left behind. That needs durable state
//! this trait deliberately does not carry, and the verdict is the
//! orchestrator's own supervised boot coming up, not a call from the image
//! that set the trial pending.
//!
//! A board that wants one gate for both can implement this trait over its
//! [`SelfUpdate`] session; nothing here forbids it. What does not work is one
//! trait for both via a supertrait bound: `confirm` with no trial open
//! succeeds here and is an error on a session, and `is_pending` cannot say
//! "confirmed, but the anti-rollback floor has not moved yet".

/// Commit capability: confirm or revert an image that was activated but not
/// committed, once its boot has been judged.
///
/// Activating an update picks the staged image as the next thing to boot and
/// stops there, whether the eRoT does that itself through
/// [`Updatable::activate`](crate::Updatable::activate) or a PLDM firmware
/// device does it for the eRoT. This trait is the other half: keep that image
/// if its boot was good, or throw it away.
///
/// Implemented for the downstream devices whose slot choice the eRoT drives,
/// behind interposed flash or over PLDM. A device that commits on its own,
/// a PLDM firmware device picking its own slot, has no
/// `DeviceTrialBoot` on the eRoT side, the same split as
/// [`SvnFloor`](crate::SvnFloor). The eRoT's own
/// image has [`SelfUpdate`](crate::SelfUpdate), which holds the same gate
/// plus the state a verdict reached after a reset needs.
///
/// `confirm` and `revert` take no arguments. A device has at most one trial
/// open at a time, the one the last activation set pending, so there is nothing to
/// name. Which slot is which stays behind the seam, as it does in
/// `Updatable`.
///
/// The record counts for the next boot only, but the trial
/// outlives it. An image that hangs, or an eRoT that loses power during the
/// trial, boots the confirmed slot again without anyone calling anything.
/// What makes that happen (a boot-select register the boot ROM clears, or
/// something like it) is the implementation's business. The record stays
/// [`is_pending`](Self::is_pending) until `confirm` or `revert`, so an
/// orchestrator that rebooted in the middle of an update finds the trial
/// again instead of losing it.
///
/// Once `confirm` returns `Ok`, the image stays confirmed across a power
/// loss. A call cut short by power loss never returns, so the next boot still
/// finds the trial open and the caller confirms again. A half-written record
/// must never leave the device booting an image nobody confirmed.
///
/// Both calls are safe to repeat: with no trial open they succeed and do
/// nothing. A caller that needs to tell a repeat from a trial that was never
/// there checks `is_pending` first, the same shape as
/// [`SvnFloor::advance`](crate::SvnFloor::advance). Neither call boots
/// anything; they only move slot metadata. Restarting the device is
/// [`BootControl`](crate::BootControl).
///
/// `is_pending` is a yes or no. It does not say whether the pending image has
/// booted, and this trait cannot tell a `confirm` that came after a watched
/// boot from one that did not. Nothing needs that difference: a half-done
/// update is rerun from the start, not picked up where it left off.
/// Confirming only what was actually watched is up to the caller, the same
/// way [`BootControl`](crate::BootControl)'s caller keeps a device in reset
/// until it has been checked. Which slot the running image booted from is not
