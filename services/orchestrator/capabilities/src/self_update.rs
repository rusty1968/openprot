//! The [`SelfUpdate`] persistent session contract for the eRoT's own image.
//!
//! An update that activates a new image and self-resets has to survive the
//! reboot: the running code is gone, and with it every RAM fact about what was
//! staged and why. This trait is what the next boot reads. It holds one
//! session at a time, because the eRoT updates itself one image at a time.
//!
//! Downstream devices need no persistent session. A reset loses the boot
//! observation that would decide the trial, so the only safe action for a
//! downstream device after a reset is abandon, and
//! [`Updatable::abandon`](crate::Updatable::abandon) is infallible and
//! unconditional: calling it on every device at boot gets the same result with
//! no storage. This trait exists for the eRoT's own image only, one per
//! platform.
//!
//! The session carries the state, not only the verified SVN, because the state
//! is what tells two crashes apart. A session that knew only the SVN would read
//! the same after a crash before the trial was marked pending and after a
//! confirmed trial whose floor advance had not run yet, and those need opposite
//! actions:
//! the first has to be dropped, the second has to advance the anti-rollback
//! floor. Advancing it on the first would push the floor past the image that is
//! running.
//!
//! [`trial_outcome`] reads the session and the image the eRoT booted and says
//! what happened to the trial. What to do about it is the state machine's, the
//! same split [`BootWatch`](crate::BootWatch) and [`Recovery`](crate::Recovery)
//! already use: the seam answers with a verdict, the machine decides.

///
/// [`prepare`](Self::prepare) records a new session from any state,

/// [`revert`](Self::revert) drops whatever is in flight. Both endings land on
/// `Idle`; they are separate calls because the caller reaching them is
/// different, the commit path and the abandon path.
///
/// Every call is idempotent: repeating a transition that already happened
/// succeeds and changes nothing, the same shape
/// [`SvnFloor::advance`](crate::SvnFloor::advance) uses. A caller that needs
/// to tell a repeat from a session that was never there reads
/// [`state`](Self::state) first.
///
/// # Durability
///
/// A transition that returns `Ok` survives power loss, and a transition cut
/// short by power loss leaves the state before the call or the state the call
/// wrote, never a mix. Storage that cannot write a state atomically gets there
/// the usual way, two copies with a sequence number and a checksum, writing
/// the stale copy and reading the newest valid one.
///
/// # Boot bound
///
/// A boot selector that holds the pending mark across resets boots the trial
/// again
/// after every reset, so a trial image that dies before anything confirms it
/// loops forever unless something counts attempts. A selector that consumes
/// the mark does not have this problem: the second boot runs the confirmed
/// image. Platforms in the first category need a ROM-side boot counter or
/// equivalent bound on how many boots a trial gets.
///
/// # Ordering
///
/// Record first, then mark pending. A crash between the two leaves
