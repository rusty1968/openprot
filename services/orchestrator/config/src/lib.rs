/// it waits. Retry policy is deliberately not table data: a retry
/// re-resets the device and re-runs the whole walk, so budgets are
/// per boot attempt and owned by the orchestrator state machine.
///
/// The signal is a board-defined id, the schema attaches no meaning to
/// it and names no signal kinds. Each board defines its own vocabulary (a
/// small enum: a GPIO line, a progress-register threshold, a message-path
/// readiness) and gives it meaning in its `EvidenceReader`. The id is a
/// defunctionalized evidence check: data in the table instead of a
/// function, so the table stays printable, comparable, const-checkable,
/// and could one day be generated instead of written.
///
/// Fields are private so a checkpoint that violates the schema is
/// unrepresentable: [`new`](Self::new) is the only way in, and it checks.
///
/// # Example: three GPIO checkpoints
///
/// A BMC behind three GPIO ready lines (bl1 on pin 4, kernel on pin 5,
/// service on pin 6), all on the same SGPIOM bank. Each signal variant
/// maps to one `GpioBootMonitor` in the board's `EvidenceReader`, and
/// the walker (`CheckpointWalk`) walks them in declaration order.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
/// enum BmcSignal { Bl1, Kernel, Service }
