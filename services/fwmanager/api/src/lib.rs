//! Device-facing capability traits for the Boot Orchestrator.
//!
//! `BootControl` is the actuation capability: the orchestrator drives a
//! single managed device's reset without knowing which controller line it
//! maps to.
//!
//! This crate is a dependency-free leaf: it holds the capability contracts
//! and the schema for the per-board device table, and everything depends
//! downward on it. Concrete adapters bind a trait to a signal source and
//! live in their own crates, so naming a capability never drags in the stack
//! behind it — the HAL-backed `HalBootControl` is in
//! `fwmanager-hal-adapters`; other backends implement the same trait from
//! their own transport crate. Config values live in the board device tables
//! (`target/<board>/devices.rs`).
