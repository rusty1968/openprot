//! PLDM Firmware Device (FD) service.
//!
//! [`FirmwareDevice`] owns the PLDM firmware-update state machine and the
//! platform-specific flash operations.  It talks to the Update Agent (UA)
//! directly over MCTP via two [`MctpPldmTransport`] instances:
//!
//! * **`responder_transport`** – listens for inbound PLDM FW-update commands
//!   from the UA and replies in place.
//! * **`requester_transport`** – forwards FD-initiated PLDM requests (e.g.
//!   `RequestFirmwareData`) to the UA at `remote_eid` and receives the
//!   response.
//!
//! This lets a single process own the whole FD state machine and its MCTP
//! I/O, without needing to bridge to separate responder/requester processes
//! over platform-specific IPC.
//!
//! ## Buffer layout
//!
//! Both transports carry the same flat buffer convention used throughout this
//! crate:
//!
//! ```text
//! buf[0]          : MCTP message-type (0x01)
//! buf[1..]        : PLDM message (header + data)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Main loop
//!
//! Each iteration of [`FirmwareDevice::run_terminus`] performs two interleaved
//! phases:
//!
//! 1. **Initiator (outbound)** – while the FD is in update mode, generate the
//!    next FD-initiated request via [`CmdInterface::generate_initiator_request`],
//!    send it to the UA through `requester_transport`, and feed the response
//!    back via [`CmdInterface::process_initiator_response`].
//! 2. **Responder (inbound)** – poll `responder_transport` for an inbound UA
//!    command and reply via [`CmdInterface::handle_responder_msg`]. Polling
//!    every iteration keeps the responder path live during a transfer so the
//!    Update Agent can send `CancelUpdate` at any time.
