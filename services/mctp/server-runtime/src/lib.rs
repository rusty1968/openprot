//! MCTP server IPC dispatch loop.
//!
//! Wraps the platform-independent `openprot_mctp_server::{Server, dispatch}`
//! in a `util_service::ServiceLoop`. Topology-agnostic: the caller supplies
//! a list of client [`Channel`]s (identified purely by their runtime IPC
//! handle, never a named `handle::*` constant) plus a single transport wake
//! source, and [`run`] multiplexes all of them. This lets one `mctp_server`
//! process answer any number of client channels (an SPDM requester, an SPDM
//! responder, a PLDM task) without duplicating the loop.
//!
//! The only kernel-tagged MCTP server crate. The WaitGroup and the
//! mechanics of deferring a reply belong to `util_service`; the meaning of
//! a request and the time a deferred `Recv` is due belong to the `Server`.
//! This crate is the glue: it turns each loop event into a dispatch call and
//! the server's millisecond deadline into a kernel one.

/// Run the MCTP IPC dispatch loop until a fatal error.
///
/// Serves every channel in `channels`, which must be non-empty with
/// distinct handles, and wakes on `transport_signal` of `transport_handle`
/// (an inbound-frame notification).
///
/// A client request is decoded and dispatched. A `Recv` that cannot
/// complete yet is deferred: that client stays blocked, the others keep
/// being served, and the reply goes out when a message for it arrives or
/// its timeout expires.
///
/// # The transport callback
///
/// `on_transport` runs on every transport wake. It must do two things:
///
/// - feed every waiting frame to the server with `server.inbound(pkt)`;
/// - leave the wake source quiet. A `USER` signal is level-triggered and
///   stays set until its owner clears it, and this loop cannot clear it on
///   the callback's behalf. If the callback returns with the signal still
///   set, the loop wakes again at once and spins. A transport whose peer
///   clears the signal when the data is fetched (the i2c server does, on
///   `SlaveReceive`) satisfies this by draining; one that raises the signal
///   itself must clear it after draining.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// A per-channel IPC error (a misbehaving client) is logged and that
/// channel is skipped; it never stops service to the others. Only setup and
/// WaitGroup failures return, and those are the only way this returns.
