"""
Runs the paired PLDM firmware update demo from the Pi, with no Bazel involved.

test_runner.py does the same thing from a workstation, but it builds the images
and SCPs them over first. Here the images and ELFs are already sitting beside
this script, so the pins and devices from evb_config.toml are inlined and
pi_test_runner.py is called directly.

This terminal shows both boards interleaved. Each board's lines are also written
to logs/rot.log and logs/bmc.log, so a second and third SSH session can `tail -F`
one board each and watch the two sides separately. That is done for you in one
tmux window by default (`--no-tmux` opts out), and the session outlives the SSH connection -- a dropped link loses
nothing, since `tmux attach -t demo` gets back in front of it.
