//! The mock BMC as a managed device: this board's supervision vocabulary.
//!
//! Everything here is the RoT's view. The RoT drives the BMC's reset line and
//! reads its ready line, so the ids naming those two wires, the window the RoT
//! is willing to wait, and the reader that resolves an id to evidence all live
//! on this side. The BMC itself knows none of it — it boots and drives one pin.
//!
//! Both ids are enums rather than pin numbers: the table stays printable and
//! comparable, and a forgotten signal is a non-exhaustive `match`, which is a
//! build error rather than a runtime hole.
