//! IPC abstraction over Pigweed kernel channels.
//!
//! `IpcInitiator` and `IpcHandler` split the two channel roles the kernel
//! itself distinguishes (`ChannelInitiatorObject` vs `ChannelHandlerObject`),
//! so a type only has to implement the operations its role can actually
//! serve. `AsyncTransaction` is a safe layer on top of `IpcInitiator`'s
//! unsafe async trio, tracking the one-transaction-per-channel invariant
//! locally instead of leaving it to the caller.
